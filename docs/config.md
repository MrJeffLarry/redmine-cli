# Config

The red-cli tool supports both local and global configuration using the config.json file. You can override the global configuration with a local configuration.

For example, if you use one repository for one project and another repository for a different project, you can create a folder called .red in the first repository and inside it, create a file called config.json. This file can contain and override one or more configuration options, as shown below:

```bash
repo1/.red/config.json
```

This file can contain the following JSON code:

```json
{
    "project-id": 12
}
```

The value of project-id will then override the corresponding value in the global configuration.


### Complete config list options

```json
{
    "server": "https://redmine.example.com",
    "api-key": "randomkeyfromredmine",
    "user-id": 1,
    "project-id": 23,
    "editor": "",
    "pager": "",
}
```

### Editor

By default, red-cli looks for the environment variables `EDITOR`, `GIT_EDITOR`, or `VISUAL` to determine which text editor to use. If none of these environment variables are set, red-cli will use Notepad on Windows and Nano on other operating systems.

However, you can override the default text editor by using the following command:

```bash
red-cli config editor set vim
```

This command sets the text editor to Vim. You can replace "vim" with the name of any other text editor you prefer. Once you have set the text editor, red-cli will use that editor whenever you need to edit text, such as when creating or updating an issue.

### Pager

By default, red-cli prints output directly to the screen. However, you can change this behavior by modifying the configuration with the following command:

```bash
red-cli config pager set less
```

This command sets the pager to "less". You can replace "less" with the name of any other pager you prefer. Once you have set the pager, red-cli will use that pager whenever it needs to display a large amount of output. This can make it easier to read and navigate through long lists or issues.
